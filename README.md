 # Data Visualization - Bird Strike Visuals Final Project

 ## Project Overview

This project analyzes aviation bird strikes, the events in which planes collide with birds during flight. While this topic might seem niche, bird strikes are quite common and can sometimes cause significant damage to aircraft. The dataset used for this project provides detailed statistics about these incidents, including information on plane types and models, number of birds struck, the damage caused and its cost, weather conditions, bird species involved, and other related factors.

The goal of this project is to explore and visualize relationships and patterns within bird strike occurrences. By comparing factors such as plane type, number of birds struck, weather, altitude, and time frames, the project seeks to identify commonalities and trends that may help improve understanding and awareness of bird strike risks.

## Techniques

Graphing and visualization techniques play a crucial role in this project. Various types of plots, including interactive graphs, correlation analyses, and dashboards, are used to represent and compare different subsets of the data. This visual approach helps to reveal insights about the conditions surrounding bird strikes and illuminate any underlying relationships or anomalies in the data.

## Installation

To set up the required environment for running this project and its visualizations, install dependencies with either:

pip install -r requirements.txt

or, if using conda:

conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate bird-strikes-viz

## Repository Description

A data visualization and exploratory analysis project focused on aviation bird strikes. This repository contains scripts for cleaning data, generating statistical summaries, and creating interactive visual dashboards that study the patterns, frequency, and impact of bird strikes on aircraft. The project highlights key factors such as plane type, altitude, weather conditions, and temporal trends to provide insights aimed at enhancing aviation safety and wildlife interaction understanding.
